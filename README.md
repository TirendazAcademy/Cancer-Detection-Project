This repo contains files for the cancer detection project. We used [PyTorch-Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/latest/) framework to build an image classification model. To track hyperparameters and metrics, we utilized [Comet ML](https://www.comet.com/site/). We also used [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) to create a cancer detection app. To examine this project, you can check [our app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Tirendaz/Cancer-Detection) on HuggingFace.
